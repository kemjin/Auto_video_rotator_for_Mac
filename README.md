# Automated Movie Clips Rotator by using HandBrake
There was no proper FREE app for Mac that rotates movies 90 or 270 degree in the app stores or market place. 

After googling, I found that Handbrake can rotate the video. However, we should use Command line interface to do that. 

I thought this may be rough task to the computer beginner, Handbrake newbie or non-tech guys. Also, this command only rotates one video. 

I had at least 40~50 videos that I wanted to rotate and didn't want to repeat 50 times.  

So I create python script that uses Mac Handbrake to rotate the videos.

This script will find the directory you already assigned, and get every single file name, and start to rotate it. 

Feel free to modify, or reuse this code. 

Before you use this script, you should open the code, and modify the path for videos for you.
